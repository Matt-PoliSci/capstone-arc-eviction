# Motivation
  There are 3.85 million people living within the 5-county region. These people come from a wide variety of different social and/or economic backgrounds, living in rural areas to high-rises. Stable housing is one of the most important tenets of social and economic stabilitiy for an individual or household. Evictions negatively disreupt stable housing in an immediate sense and potentially in the long run. However, evictions do not occur in a uniform manner within the Atlanta Metropolitan area, with certain census tracts having very frequent eviction filing rates whilst others have significantly less frequent rates.  Due to the detrimental effects of eviction filings and evictions, our team worked to understand why certain census tracts have such high rates of eviction filings by identifying which socio-economic factors are most associated with these census tracts. Our hope is that our work can be used by the Atlanta Regional Commission so they can better assist local  governments mitigate the potential harms of evictions.
